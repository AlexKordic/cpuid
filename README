"cpuid" is a very simple C program, designed to dump and extract information
from the x86 CPUID instruction.

cpuid is capable of dumping all CPUID leaves (except any unknown leaves which
require special ECX values to dump all information). cpuid can only decode
certain leaves, but this functionality will be expanded as the CPUID
specifications provided by AMD and Intel change.
